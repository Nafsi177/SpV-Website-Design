    <h1>13 Reasons Why</h1>
    <h2 id="Netflix"> A Netflix series that i have watch and close to my heart</h2>

    <p>Welcome</p>
    <p>this is nafsi</p>
    <p>The series is set in the late 2010s in the fictional county of Evergreen, California. Most of the main characters in the series are students of Liberty High School.

        The first season follows Liberty High student Clay Jensen, who receives a set of cassette tapes at his front porch. These tapes were recorded by Hannah Baker, a former Liberty High student who had killed herself and recorded thirteen reasons why she did so on the tapes. Each tape includes a reason for the following people: Justin Foley, Jessica Davis, Alex Standall, Tyler Down, Courtney Crimsen, Marcus Cole, Zach Dempsey, Ryan Shaver, Sheri Holland, Clay himself, Hannah herself, Bryce Walker, and Kevin Porter (a school guidance counselor who is the only non-student among the tape subjects). The season features flashbacks viewed from Hannah's perspective that offer increasing clarity as to the trauma she faced during her time as a student and what ultimately led up to her own death.
        
        In the second season, Hannah's parents sue the school district after Hannah's tapes are released online. The fallout from the events of the first season and the toll it has taken on the lives of Liberty High's students is further shown. At the end of the season, Tyler attempts a school shooting after he is severely traumatized by the bully Monty, but is stopped by Clay and Tony with Tyler's gun given to Clay as Tony drives Tyler away.
        
        In the third season, which introduces a new main character Ani Achola and takes place eight months after the events of the previous season, Clay and his friends struggle to keep Tyler's cover of his attempted school shooting and helping him in his recovery. Tensions rise with the tape subjects after Bryce is killed with Clay as a suspect. In the wake of his death, Bryce's past actions and the person he has become in the aftermath of the release of Hannah's tapes is examined.
        
        In the fourth and final season, Clay begins to develop mental health issues following the deaths of Bryce and Monty, while the students are planning for their college interviews and nearing graduation.</p>
